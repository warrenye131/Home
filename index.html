			<h3> NBA Teams </h3>
			<p id="para2">
				There are a total of 30 teams in the NBA, ranging from Toronto to southern USA like Miami, Florida  and Oakland&#47;Golden State, California. Each team has their own unique play style and players &#40;obviously&#41;, and that&#39;s because each and every team has different coaches and trainers with different general managers and owners, which means people with different opinions and different perspectives which leads to differences. That's why the NBA is so fun to watch, every team has a different play style so every game is different and unique to another.

Obviously this does not happen often, but when it does it is truly a special moment for the NBA and a great time to be a fan of that team or to watch that team even.
