		<h2> What Are NBA Standings?</h2>
		<p id=para1>
			NBA Standings are very important as it tells fans and teams where there team is in the NBA in terms of success, and helps decide playoffs match&#45;ups and draft picks odds. The NBA season is made up of all 30 NBA teams playing 82 games. Then based on their win&#45;loss ratio they are placed either in the playoffs or the draft lottery, where the teams in the playoff go to play to win the championship, while teams placed in the draft lottery hope to land as high as a pick as possible with hope to use that pick to trade for a star player or to draft the next big player.
