		<h1> What is The NBA Offseason </h1>
 		<p id="para1"> The NBA offseason is the one chance NBA players get a chance to rest or to work on their game on their own. But for NBA owners and GMs it is the busiest and most stressful part of their year, because of the fact players become free agents. In addition NBA Draft happens where top prospects from all over the world hope to catch the eyes of an NBA Team and get drafted while NBA teams hope to find a franchise cornerstone to build their team around. When NBA players become free agents they can join whatever team offers a contract to them, this happens during NBA. This is where all the big name players are signed and meet up with other teams. The offseason is also a time for NBA players to do camps or to play pickup basketball or whatever they want to. Some pros even decide to work on their game for the whole summer in order to get paid next offseason. </p>

		<p id="para2"> The NBA Draft is arguably the most exciting part of the offseason, because every player must be eligible to be drafted in the draft, regardless of getting drafted or not. Majority of the greats come in the first round like Michael Jordan who got drafted with the third pick in the 1984 NBA draft, or Kobe Bryant who was drafted with the thirteenth pick in the 1996 pick or ultimately being drafted with the first pick and being a franchise piece for the team he was drafted like Lebron James. There are 60 picks overall and is separated into 2 rounds, players drafted in the first round are must be signed with guaranteed rookie contracts. While second round picks must prove themselves in training camp or a summer league to impress their coaches in order to get their contract. Rookie contracts are very special as they can only have a contract cap which only allows them to be paid a certain amount of money, and will always have a 2 year team option. </p>
